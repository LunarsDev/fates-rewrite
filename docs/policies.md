## Bot Requirements

These are some requirements we test for and require. Note that this list is **non-inclusive**

<blockquote class="quote">

### Basics

1. It is perfectly OK to submit bots and servers that are in competition with Fates List (such as API/manager bots of other bot lists with their permission)
2. Your bot may not be a fork or instance of another bot without substantial modifications and prior permission from the owner of the bot you have forked/made an instance of.
3. Your bot should handle errors in a user-friendly way. A way of reporting errors is a nice extra tidbit to have though not strictly required. Giving tracebacks is allowed if it does not leak sensitive information such as bot tokens or private information on a user.
4. Your bot must respect the Discord API and rate-limits. This also means that your bot should not spam messages or be a 'rainbow role' bot.
5. Your bot must follow the Discord ToS and guidelines. This also includes no invite rewards, no nuking etc.
6. Custom bots based of/dependent on/running an instance of another bot such as bot-makers not allowed by discord, BotGhost, MEE6 Premium, Wick VIP is prohibited unless it has unique features that you have added to it and can be configured on other servers by users.
7. For frameworks such as redbot, you must have at least 3 custom-made cogs (or the equivalent for other frameworks). You must give credits to any framework you are using. *BDFD/BDScript/other bot makers are not allowed on Fates List unless it is also allowed by Discord and your bot is high-quality and has features*

### Commands

1. Your bot must have a working help command
2. If your bot has level messages or welcome messages, it must be optional and disableable
3. Your bot should not DM users when it join unless it needs to DM the *owner* important or sensitive information (such as Wick's rescue key) 
4. Your bot should not DM users when they join a server unless a server manager chooses to enable such a feature. Bots that do need to DM users such as verification bots may be exempt from this rule on a case by case basis
5. All commands of a bot should check user and their own permissions before doing any action. For example, your bot should not kick users unless the user and the bot has the Kick Members permission. *Commands may not be admin locked and NSFW commands must be locked to NSFW channels*
6. Commands must have a purpose (no filler commands). Filler commands are ignored and will make your bot low quality. An example of filler commands/commands with no purpose is a bot with 20 purge commands or commands which are repeated in different ways or serve the same purpose
7. Bots *should* have at least 5 working commands and at least 80% of commands shown in its help command working. If your bot has a really unique feature however, this rule may be reconsidered for your bot.
8. Sensitive commands (such as eval) should be locked to bot owners only. Fates List is not responsible for the code you run or for any arbitary code execution/privilege escalation on your bot.

### Prefixes

1. Bots with common prefixes (`!`, `?`, `.`, `;`) should have a customizable prefix or they may be muted on the support server. You may change the prefix for just Fates List if you want to and staff can do it for you if you tell them the command.
2. You should use the Customizable Prefix feature in your bots settings to denote whather custom prefixes are supported. This is to make it easier for users to know this
3. Your bot must have an easy way to find its prefix. Some good places for this are on bot mentions and bot status


</blockquote>

<blockquote class="quote">

### Safety

1. Bots should not mass DM or be malicious in any way such as mass nuke, scam bots, free nitro bots. This also applies to servers as well when server listing is done.
2. DMing staff to ask for your bot to be approved/reviewed is strictly prohibited. Your bot will be denied or banned if you do so. You may however ask staff politely to review/show off your bot on your support server if it needs to be verified.
3. Your bot must not have a copyrighted avatar or username. All assets used in your bot must be either owned by you or with permission from the copyright owner.
4. Abusing Discord (mass creating or deleting channels, mass DM/spam/nuke bots) is strictly prohibited and doing so will get you and/or your bot banned from the list and server.
5. Your bot may not be hosted on a Glitch Free Plan and use a software to ping your project. This is against the Glitch ToS.
6. Your bot must be online during testing


</blockquote>

<blockquote class="quote">

### Notes

- You can always appeal a ban or resubmit your bot. To do so, just login, click your username > My Profile > *your bot* > View and then click the link underneath the ban message to start the ban appeal or resubmission process

## Certification Requirements

This section includes the *additional* requirements for certification. This list builds *on top of* the above basic Bot Requirements

<blockquote class="info quote">

### How to certify?

- You can certify a bot from `Bot Settings`
- A bot must first be approved before it can be certified

</blockquote>

<blockquote class="quote">

### Basics

1. Your bot must have a banner (either bot card and/or bot page)
2. Your bot should have a high quality bot page including a good long/short description and good banner choices
3. Your bot must be verified and in at least 100 servers at minimum. A recommendation that may result in a denial is the requirement of 500 servers but this is decided on a per-case basis. Hundred servers is minimum however
4. Your bot will be held up to higher standards than normal and also represents Fates List as a whole
5. Your bot must post stats to Fates List at least once per month or it will be uncertified. Vote webhooks for Fates List is recommended and this does affect certification however it is not a hard requirement
6. Your bot must have a consistent uptime and communicate with its users on maintenances and other downtime consistently
7. Your bot must have unique features or be the first to have said features. It must implement these features in a good high-quality way that conforms to users expectations
8. Your bot must meet our bot requirements as well as the certification requirements
9. Your bot may be exempted from requirements it does not meet on a case by case basis that staff (Admins/Mods+) will decide and/or vote on. We will let you know more information during the process
10. You may apply for certification on our support server by creating a support ticket with Certification as the selected option. Your bot will undergo some basic automated checks and will then be sent to us. We will DM you when we are retesting your bot and for any updates or other info we have. Having a closed DM/friend requests will result in denial!

</blockquote>

<blockquote class="quote">

### Commands

1. At least 98% to 100% of all commands should work unless the bot does not *have* commands (chat bots etc)
2. All commands must implement error handling. Using embeds is recommended in commands
3. The majority of all commands should gave clear documentation on how to use it, preferably with examples

</blockquote>

<blockquote class="quote">

### Perks

1. Certified Bots appear higher on the main page and will be above all bots other than the random bot
2. Special channel to show off certified bots and potential access to #general or a channel for just your bot!
3. Access to in-development 'unstable' API endpoints and potentially some certified bot only features
4. Little to no API rate-limits as you are trusted to use the API responsibly. This *will* get revoked and your bot *may* be banned if you abuse this (decided on a case by case basis)!
5. More coming soon ❤️

<blockquote class="quote">

### Server Listing

1. Fates List is not responsible for activities ongoing on listed servers. We cannot verify these servers as we do with bots as they may not be honest. That being said, any server that violates our rules should be reported. They will be banned as soon as we verify they violate our rules. We will randomly check servers to ensure they follow our rules and users are recommended to report all servers breaking the below rules immediately! Furthermore, we require all servers on server listing to be Community Servers. We will take steps such as manual server verification if users attempt to spam servers violating our rules or third-party rights such as intellectual property.
2. Servers may not promote illegal activity such as gambling (of any form), violation of basic human rights (such as servers attempting to dox, harm or harass other members), intellectual property laws (piracy servers as a example) and copyright laws. *This may lead to a ban with no chance of appeal depending on severity!*
3. **All servers must follow [Discord Community Guidelines](https://discord.com/guidelines). They must also be a community server in order to be listed and must have a explicit content filter set to scan messages from all members. This may lead to a ban with no chance of appeal as well!**
4. All servers must adhere to human rights laws. This includes promoting or participating in doxxing, hate speech, sexual harassment or self-harm which is *not* allowed on Fates List in any shape or form. Servers may not promote the spread of misinformation nor may they violate export laws and other regulation.
5. Servers may not 'scalp' tags or in any way attempt to harm other servers through Fates List Server Listing *or* other means.
6. All vanities set must be safe-for-work. There are checks to try and ensure this but the list of words is indefinite. All vanities must be set with benevolent intent (as in, it must not be set to harm other users or to grief servers)
7. To protect your privacy, all servers have 'Requires Login To Join' enabled by default. This can be changed using ``/set``.
8. You may not use Fates List Server Listing to aid in any critical activity where failure may lead to personal injury. You may also not use Fates List Server Listing as a payment provider or middleman in any shape or form.
9. **Fates List Server Listing is not a gambling system neither are votes**. By using this service you agree to not use Fates List Server Listing for such purposes. This list is non-exhaustive and may lead to a ban with no chance of appeal or even bans on specific owners as it is unacceptable to do so and is illegal in many places.
10. **Monetizing Fates List Server Listing, reproduction or sale of information in Fates List Server Listing without written permission from server admins is strictly strictly probihited. In an event something like this happens, we WILL attempt to contact all members on the server targetted (if possible) and all members involved in the violation will be immediately banned with no chance of appeal.**
11. **We allow servers to set their own invite links or for a randomly generated link (which expires in 15 minutes) if the user does not set a invite. We also allow for whitelist-only servers as well as the ability to blacklist raiding members. We highly recommend all servers use these features to protect themselves**
12. Users must explicitly agree to join your server out of their own free will. This means that you may not use Fates List Server Listing to enforce users join your guild for a specific reward.
13. **By using server listing, you agree for your server to be publicly listed on our stats page and API for easier moderation. You can opt out by setting state to private_viewable**
14. This list is non-exhaustive and malicious violations/loopholes of the rules will be counted as breaking them.
15. **When you as a user last voted for a server is *public* to otther users**

- We rely on reports in most cases to perform actions. This is because it is unfeasible to go through every single server. We require servers to be community servers to aid in moderation.
- Feel free to DM Rootspring#6701 if you have any questions.

## Data Collection And Security

This section relates to how we process, secure and handle data as per the GDPR and other local privacy laws

<blockquote class="quote">

### Collection

We cache user information from Discord as well as handling ratelimits using Redis to significantly improve site performance and your experience using the site. We store data on bots using PostgreSQL. Information you give us, such as bots information, badges you or your bots earn in the future, and your profile information is all stored on our servers. We also may log user information temporarily to console however these logs are not persistent. We also use IPC over Redis for most if not all Discord API related activities and data transferred over IPC is only temporarily stored in Redis for a maximum of 30 seconds to one minute.

</blockquote>

<blockquote class="quote">

### Deletion

You can easily have your data deleted at any time. You may delete your account by opening a Data Deletion Request below on Lynx or by DMing `Rootspring#6701`. You can delete your bots from Bot Settings. Data Deletion Requests may take up to 24 hours to process and the time of when you last vote will still be stored to prevent against abuse. All of your bots will also be deleted permanently and this is irreversible

</blockquote>

<blockquote class="quote">

### Access

Fates List needs to access your username, avatar, status and user id in order to identify who you are on Discord so you can use the site. Fates List also needs to know which servers you are in for server listing if you choose to enable it. Fates List also needs the ability to join servers for you if you choose to be automatically added to the support server on login.

</blockquote>

<blockquote class="quote">

### Fates List Helper

We log all interactions with Fates List Heloer *temporarily* to console. Note that these logs are *private*, not permanently stored and are only used for debugging purposes.

</blockquote>

<blockquote class="quote">

### Staff

We log all admin actions taken on Lynx for anti-nuke and debugging purposes. We may or may not permanently (within the realms of local law) store this data however this is not yet implemented.

</blockquote>

<blockquote class="quote">

### Security

1. Our site is secure and we try to ensure that only you and Fates List Staff can edit your bot and that all actions require proper permission and clearance to be used. We may regenerate API tokens if needed.
2. We backup our database on Google Drive. This backup is encrypted by ``rclone`` using AES and the configuration file for rclone is also encrypted
3. All data *should* be encrypted at rest. Mistakes however may happen and Fates List does not take any responsibility for any data breaches that may occur. We also do not recommend sharing of private information such as addresses on Fates List
4. Our site is hosted on Digital Ocean. You can find the privacy policy of Digital Ocean [here](https://www.digitalocean.com/legal/privacy-policy). All data on Fates List should hence be considered to be available for access by Digital Ocean as per their terms

</blockquote>

<blockquote class="quote">

### Privacy

1. Your privacy matters to us. By continuing, you agree to your data being processed and/or stored for analytical purpose such as statistics as per our privacy policy. This information is not shared with third-parties whatsoever and is kept confidential
2. The data we collect is your IP address, username, user id, avatar and any info you submit to us.
3. We may also use IPs for access logs. Due to technical reasons, these cannot be easily deleted from our servers so please use a VPN if you do not want your IP to be exposed to us.
4. We also store timestamps of when you vote for a bot and these timestamps are exposed to bot owners via our API which they may then use for their own purposes such as determining whether you can vote for a bot or not.
5. We may release user data to law enforcement if requested by law. We will also try our best to notify affected parties however this may not be possible in all cases. By using Fates List, you agree to this.
6. By using the Fates List API, you agree that all requests made to the site will be logged by ``Actix Web`` (api-v3), ``uvicorn`` (widgets, lynx) and ``nginx``. Apart from ``nginx``, these logs are not stored persistently 
and are merely logged to console as of this time. This can change without notice however. These logs include request method, URL and the ``Cloudflare IP`` that connected to the site. While cloudflare does share all IP addresses with us, 
we do not use this whatsoever for privacy purposes. We do not use IP addresses for any purposes beyond preventing Distributed Denial Of Services (and the IP address logged cannot anyways be correlated back as it is not your real IP but rather a Cloudflare-anonymized one)

### Avid Voter

The Avid Voter badge will be given if you vote for over 5 different bots and 3 different servers and have voted for a specific bot for at least 3 times

In addition, certified developer badges are coming back as well in the near future 

Some rules regarding the badge:

1. There are no special perks other than a badge

## Data Actions

We believe your data belongs to *you*

**These actions can only be done for your *own* user id for security purposes unless you are sudo on the list (which is our version of an owner)**

### Request Data

Click "Request My Data" if you wish to request a copy of your data.

<a href="{%sunbeam%}/frostpaw/data?act=request"><button class="doc-button">Request My Data</button></a>

### Data Deletion Request

- This is irreversible
- This will delete *all* bots you are a main owner of *without warning*
- There is no way to readd deleted bots unless you manually fill out all bot information again
- **All votes you have ever made will be wiped. In the future, this *may* also trigger a 'data deletion webhook' to all voted bots**. This may lead to chargebacks or revoking of vote rewards from such bots.
- Actual servers in server listing are not removed by a Data Deletion Request as we do not store such information regarding server owners/managers etc. due to privacy concerns (servers are *not* associated with their owners/admins/moderators on our database whatsoever and we do not store such information). Instead, server owners should use /delserver instead which permanently deletes the server from server listing.
- This does not delete vote epoch which is temporary anyways which is removed after 8 hours automatically. This is to prevent abuse
